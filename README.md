### Pyawp
The Python package `pyawp` is used for writing the input source files, but its
use case may be extended for other preprocessing and postprocessing tasks in the
near future. To install this package, simply go to the directory `pyawp`
and type:
```bash
$ pip install .
```
to install a local copy.
